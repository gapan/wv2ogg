INSTALLING
----------

To install, just run:

  make install

as root. The script will be installed in $(DESTDIR)/$(PREFIX)/bin/wv2ogg
The default value for DESTDIR is / and for PREFIX it is /usr/local. You
can specify either/both of them if you like:

  make install DESTDIR=/path/to/target/dir PREFIX=/usr/local

UNINSTALLING
------------

Just delete the wv2ogg file from wherever it was installed.
