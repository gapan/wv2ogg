wv2ogg
------

wv2ogg is a tool that uses wvunpack, oggenc and vorbiscomment to encode
wavpack files to ogg vorbis files. The quality setting which will be
used for encoding the vorbis files can be set when running wv2ogg. It will
also transfer all tags and replaygain information from the wavpack files
to the ogg vorbis files by default. wv2ogg was written because no other
software that would do that existed in Linux.

The default quality setting for vorbis files is -q 3. The resulting ogg
vorbis files are always placed in the current directory.

Run 'wv2ogg -h' to see all command line options.

Usage examples:

wv2ogg *.wv
	will encode all wavpack files in the current directory to ogg
	vorbis files transfering al tags and replaygain information. Ogg
	vorbis files will be encoded with -q 3 (the default setting)

wv2ogg -q 5 a.wv /home/george/b.wv
	will encode file a.wv in the current directory and file b.wv in
	/home/george to a.ogg and b.ogg which will be placed in the
	current directory. The two .ogg files will be encoded with -q 5

wv2ogg -q 4.5 -r /home/george/a.wv
	will encode file /home/george/a.wv into an a.ogg file in the
	current directory with -q 4.5 (you can use up to 2 decimal
	points), will tranfer all tags, but it will not transfer any
	replaygain information
